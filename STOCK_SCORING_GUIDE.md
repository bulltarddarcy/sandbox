# 📊 Stock Scoring Guide - Early Entry System

**A Complete Guide to Understanding Stock Rankings**

---

## 🎯 THE GOAL: Catch the Wave Early, Don't Chase the Ship

**What This System Is Designed For:**
This scoring system is built to identify stocks **at the inflection point** - those transitioning from neutral/lagging into outperformance. We want to catch rotation INTO themes and stocks BEFORE they become obvious leaders.

**What This System Is NOT:**
This is not designed to highlight stocks that are already leading and extended. If a stock has alpha of +8% and has been outperforming for weeks, that's great if you're already in it - but it's **too late to enter**. This system will actually **penalize** those setups because the best risk/reward has passed.

**Trading Philosophy:**
- ✅ **Catch the turn** → Enter when momentum shifts from negative to positive
- ✅ **Ride the middle** → Capture the bulk of the move (days 1-15)
- ✅ **Exit before the top** → Take profits when extended
- ❌ **Don't chase** → Avoid stocks already up 10-15% in their move

**Think of it like surfing:** You want to catch the wave as it's forming (paddling position), not after it's already cresting. By the time everyone sees it's a great wave, it's too late to paddle in.

## 📐 The Scoring System (0-100 Points)

**Total: 100 Points Possible**

### Breakdown:
1. **Setup Quality (40 points)** - Is this stock at an inflection point?
2. **Entry Timing (30 points)** - Is RIGHT NOW the best time to enter?
3. **Risk/Reward (20 points)** - How much upside vs downside?
4. **Sector Context (10 points)** - Is the sector at the right stage?

**Letter Grades:**
- **A (80-100):** Elite setup - highest conviction entry
- **B (70-79):** Strong setup - good entry opportunity
- **C (60-69):** Decent setup - selective or small position
- **D (50-59):** Marginal - pass unless special situation
- **F (0-49):** Poor - avoid completely

---

## 🎯 FACTOR 1: Setup Quality (40 Points)

**Purpose:** Identify stocks at the **beginning** of outperformance, not the end.

### Part A: Position Relative to Sector (20 points)

This measures where the stock is in its cycle relative to the sector. The best setups are when the sector is strong but the stock hasn't moved yet.

#### **Catching Up Play: +20 points** (BEST SETUP)

**Criteria (ALL must be true):**
1. Sector is Leading or Improving (score 70+)
2. Stock alpha 5-day: 0% to +2% (neutral to slightly positive)
3. Stock alpha 20-day: -2% to 0% (was lagging, now turning)
4. RVOL 5-day: 1.2x+ (volume confirming the turn)

**Why This Scores Highest:**
The sector is already hot (institutions are rotating IN), but this stock hasn't participated yet. This is the classic "last to wake up" play. You're catching it at the inflection point.

**Real Example:**
```
Technology Sector: 85 (A) - Early Stage Leadership (Day 3)

Stock: INTC
- Sector Alpha: The sector is outperforming by 3-5%
- Stock Alpha 20d: -1.5% (was underperforming)
- Stock Alpha 10d: -0.3% (turning neutral)
- Stock Alpha 5d: +0.8% (just turned positive!)
- RVOL: 1.4x (volume picking up)

Score: +20 points ✓

Translation: "Tech sector is hot. INTC was lagging but just started 
moving. Perfect timing to enter before it catches up to peers."
```

#### **Emerging Leader: +15 points** (CLEAN SETUP)

**Criteria (ALL must be true):**
1. Sector is Improving (building momentum)
2. Stock alpha 5-day: +1% to +3% (slightly leading)
3. Stock showing acceleration: 5d alpha > 10d alpha > 20d alpha
4. RVOL 5-day: 1.2x+

**Why This Scores High:**
Both the sector and stock are building momentum together. This is a clean, early-stage setup where everything is confirming at once.

**Real Example:**
```
Materials Sector: 72 (B) - Early Stage Leadership (Day 2)

Stock: NUE (Nucor Steel)
- Stock Alpha 20d: +0.5% (starting positive)
- Stock Alpha 10d: +1.2% (improving)
- Stock Alpha 5d: +2.1% (accelerating)
- RVOL: 1.3x

Score: +15 points ✓

Translation: "Both sector and stock are building together. 
Clean, confirmed move in early stages."
```

#### **Laggard Awakening: +12 points** (CATCH-UP TRADE)

**Criteria (ALL must be true):**
1. Sector just turned bullish (Fresh - Day 1-3)
2. Stock alpha 20-day: -3% to -1% (was lagging badly)
3. Stock alpha 5-day: 0% to +2% (just starting to move)
4. Stock is one of the weaker names in the sector (bottom quartile)

**Why This Scores Well:**
When a sector rotates, the laggards often catch up fast. If the sector just turned bullish and this stock was the worst performer but is now waking up, it has significant catch-up potential.

**Real Example:**
```
Energy Sector: 78 (B) - Early Stage Leadership (Day 1)

Stock: OXY (Occidental Petroleum)
- Sector just turned bullish yesterday
- Stock Alpha 20d: -2.8% (was worst in sector)
- Stock Alpha 5d: +0.5% (just started moving)
- Relative to peers: Was 11th out of 12 stocks, now moving

Score: +12 points ✓

Translation: "Energy just rotated bullish. OXY was the laggard 
but is now catching fire. Room to catch up to peers."
```

#### **Emerging from Neutral: +8 points** (EARLY BUT UNCONFIRMED)

**Criteria:**
1. Stock alpha 20-day: -1% to +1% (neutral)
2. Stock alpha 5-day: +1% to +3% (starting to lead)
3. Sector is neutral or improving (not yet strong)

**Why This Scores Moderate:**
The move is very early. Sector hasn't confirmed yet, stock is showing early strength. Higher risk but potentially earlier entry.

**Real Example:**
```
Healthcare Sector: 65 (C) - Medium Conviction

Stock: UNH
- Stock Alpha 5d: +1.8%
- Stock Alpha 20d: +0.2%
- Sector not fully confirmed yet

Score: +8 points

Translation: "Early move, but sector hasn't confirmed. 
Speculative entry."
```

#### **Already Leading: +5 points** (GOOD STOCK, LATE ENTRY)

**Criteria:**
1. Stock alpha 5-day: +3% to +5%
2. Stock alpha 10-day: +2.5% to +4%
3. Stock alpha 20-day: +2% to +4%
4. Positive on all timeframes (consistent)

**Why This Scores LOW:**
The stock is already a leader. It's been outperforming for 2-3 weeks. While it might continue, the best entry was 10-15 days ago. You'd be buying at the middle or late stage.

**Real Example:**
```
Technology Sector: 82 (A) - Established Leadership (Day 12)

Stock: NVDA
- Stock Alpha 20d: +3.5%
- Stock Alpha 10d: +4.2%
- Stock Alpha 5d: +4.8%
- Consistently leading for 2 weeks

Score: +5 points

Translation: "Great stock, but been leading for weeks. 
You'd be chasing strength."
```

#### **Already Extended: -10 points** (TOO LATE - PENALTY)

**Criteria (ANY trigger penalty):**
1. Stock alpha 5-day: +5% or more (way ahead)
2. Stock alpha 10-day: +4% or more AND been positive for 10+ days
3. Price is >10% above 21 EMA (stretched)
4. Sector is Established (Day 8+) AND stock has been leading

**Why This Gets PENALIZED:**
This ship has sailed. The stock has already had its move. Entering here means you're buying at elevated levels with poor risk/reward. Wait for a pullback.

**Real Example:**
```
Technology Sector: 87 (A) - Established Leadership (Day 15)

Stock: NVDA
- Stock Alpha 5d: +8.2% (extreme)
- Stock Alpha 10d: +7.5% (extreme)
- Stock Alpha 20d: +6.8% (extreme)
- Price: +18% above 21 EMA (very stretched)
- Been leading for 15+ days

Score: -10 points ✗

Translation: "Already ran 15%+ in 3 weeks. Way too extended. 
Great if you're in, terrible entry if you're not. WAIT FOR PULLBACK."
```

---

### Part B: Trend Reversal Quality (20 points)

This measures the quality of the momentum shift - how clean is the turn from negative to positive?

#### **Fresh Breakout: +20 points** (HIGHEST QUALITY)

**Criteria (ALL must be true):**
1. Stock alpha 20-day: -2% to -0.5% (was underperforming)
2. Stock alpha 10-day: -0.5% to +0.5% (neutral zone)
3. Stock alpha 5-day: +0.5% to +2.5% (just turned positive)
4. RVOL 5-day: 1.3x or higher (volume confirming)
5. Price just crossed above a key level (50 SMA or 21 EMA within 3 days)

**Why This Scores Highest:**
This is the textbook reversal pattern. The stock was lagging, consolidated, and is now breaking out with volume. You're catching it at the exact inflection point.

**Real Example:**
```
Stock: AMD

3 weeks ago (20d): Alpha -1.8% (lagging)
2 weeks ago (10d): Alpha -0.2% (neutral)
This week (5d): Alpha +1.2% (breaking out)

RVOL: 1.5x (strong confirmation)
Price: Just crossed above 50 SMA yesterday

Score: +20 points ✓✓

Translation: "Classic reversal. Was lagging, found support, 
now breaking out with volume. Catch it NOW."
```

#### **Dip Buy in Strong Stock: +15 points** (BUY STRENGTH ON WEAKNESS)

**Criteria (ALL must be true):**
1. Stock alpha 20-day: +3% or more (was strong)
2. Stock alpha 5-day: 0% to +1.5% (pulled back to neutral)
3. Price still above 21 EMA (trend intact)
4. Price within 5% of 21 EMA or 50 SMA (near support)
5. RVOL normal or slightly elevated (1.0-1.3x)

**Why This Scores High:**
Strong stocks consolidate and rest. This is a lower-risk entry in an already-proven winner. You're buying a pullback in a stock that's shown it can lead.

**Real Example:**
```
Stock: TSLA

1 month ago (20d): Alpha +4.5% (strong leader)
Last week: Pulled back, alpha dropped to +0.8%
Now (5d): Alpha +0.6% (resting)

Price: $245 (21 EMA at $242 - very close)
RVOL: 1.1x (normal)

Score: +15 points ✓

Translation: "Was leading, took a breather, now at support. 
Classic buy-the-dip setup in a strong name."
```

#### **Continuation Pattern: +12 points** (BUILDING ON STRENGTH)

**Criteria:**
1. Stock alpha positive on all timeframes
2. Alpha 5d: +2% to +4% (not too extended)
3. Consolidating after initial move (ATR stable)
4. Above key moving averages

**Why This Scores Moderate:**
The stock already made an initial move and is now consolidating. This is the "second leg" setup. Good, but not as clean as a fresh breakout.

**Real Example:**
```
Stock: GOOGL

Made initial move 2 weeks ago (+3%)
Consolidated for 5 days
Now resuming: Alpha 5d +2.8%

Score: +12 points

Translation: "First move done, consolidation done, 
starting second leg."
```

#### **Already Leading - Extended: +5 points** (LATE)

**Criteria:**
1. Alpha positive on all timeframes
2. Alpha 5-day: +4% to +6%
3. Been positive for 2+ weeks
4. No recent consolidation

**Why This Scores Low:**
The trend is clear and strong, but you're late. This is the "everyone already knows" stage.

**Real Example:**
```
Stock: AAPL

Alpha 20d: +5.2%
Alpha 10d: +5.8%
Alpha 5d: +5.5%
Been leading for 18 days

Score: +5 points

Translation: "Clearly strong, but been running for 3 weeks. 
Late entry."
```

#### **Choppy / No Clear Pattern: +0 points** (AVOID)

**Criteria:**
1. Alpha bouncing between positive and negative
2. No consistent direction
3. Volume erratic

**Why This Scores Zero:**
No clear setup. Wait for clarity.

---

## ⏰ FACTOR 2: Entry Timing (30 Points)

**Purpose:** Determine if RIGHT NOW is the optimal time to enter, or if you should wait.

### Part A: Price Position (15 points)

Where is the price relative to key technical levels? Best entries are near support or at fresh breakouts.

#### **Near Support (Pullback Entry): +15 points**

**Criteria (ALL must be true):**
1. Price within 2% of 21 EMA OR within 3% of 50 SMA
2. Price still above 200 SMA (long-term uptrend intact)
3. Recent low held (didn't break support)
4. Volume drying up on pullback (sign of no selling pressure)

**Why This Scores Highest:**
You're buying at a technical support level with a clear stop. Risk/reward is excellent here.

**Real Example:**
```
Stock: MSFT

Price: $425
21 EMA: $423 (within 0.5% - AT support)
50 SMA: $418
200 SMA: $390

Recent action: Pulled back to 21 EMA, bounced

Score: +15 points ✓

Translation: "Perfect entry at support. If it breaks $420, 
you're out. If it bounces, you're in early."
```

#### **Fresh Breakout: +15 points**

**Criteria (ANY trigger):**
1. Price crossed above 50 SMA within last 5 days
2. Price crossed above 21 EMA with volume spike
3. Price breaking out of consolidation range (3+ weeks)

**Why This Scores Highest:**
Breakouts are high-probability entries. You're catching the move as it starts.

**Real Example:**
```
Stock: NEM

Was consolidating $40-$42 for 4 weeks
Yesterday broke out to $42.50
Today at $43 (+7% above 50 SMA)

Score: +15 points ✓

Translation: "Fresh breakout just happened. Enter now 
before it runs too far."
```

#### **Tight Consolidation: +12 points**

**Criteria:**
1. ATR (volatility) has contracted by 30%+ vs 30-day average
2. Price range narrowing (Bollinger Bands squeezing)
3. Volume declining (coiling)

**Why This Scores High:**
Volatility contraction often precedes expansion. This is the calm before the storm.

**Real Example:**
```
Stock: CAT

Normal daily range: $5
Last 10 days range: $2 (ATR down 60%)
Bollinger Bands: Tightest in 2 months

Score: +12 points

Translation: "Coiled spring. Big move coming soon."
```

#### **Neutral Zone: +8 points**

**Criteria:**
- Price between 21 EMA and 50 SMA
- No clear breakout or support test
- Normal volatility

**Why This Scores Moderate:**
Not a perfect entry, but not bad either. Neutral timing.

#### **Extended from Entry: -10 points** (PENALTY)

**Criteria (ANY trigger):**
1. Price >10% above 21 EMA
2. Price >15% above 50 SMA
3. No consolidation in 2+ weeks (parabolic move)

**Why This Gets Penalized:**
Price has moved too far too fast. Likely to consolidate or pull back. Wait.

**Real Example:**
```
Stock: NVDA

Price: $180
21 EMA: $160 (12.5% below)
50 SMA: $155 (16% below)

Score: -10 points ✗

Translation: "Overextended. Wait for pullback to $165 
before considering entry."
```

---

### Part B: Volume Pattern (15 points)

Volume tells you if institutions are participating. Best setups show building volume.

#### **Building Volume (Accumulation): +15 points**

**Criteria (ALL must be true):**
1. RVOL 5-day: 1.2x to 1.8x (elevated but not crazy)
2. RVOL accelerating: RVOL 5d > RVOL 10d > RVOL 20d
3. Price rising on volume, falling on low volume (healthy)

**Why This Scores Highest:**
Institutions are accumulating. This is smart money coming in gradually - the best kind of volume.

**Real Example:**
```
Stock: JPM

RVOL 20d: 1.0x (normal)
RVOL 10d: 1.2x (picking up)
RVOL 5d: 1.4x (accelerating)

Price pattern:
- Up days: 1.5x average volume
- Down days: 0.8x average volume

Score: +15 points ✓

Translation: "Smart money accumulating. Healthy volume 
pattern showing institutional interest."
```

#### **Explosive Volume (Breakout): +12 points**

**Criteria:**
1. RVOL 5-day: 2.0x or higher (very high)
2. Single-day volume spike coinciding with price move
3. Breakout from range

**Why This Scores High (but less than building):**
Major move happening NOW. Could be early if it's a breakout, could be late if it's a climax. Slightly riskier than gradual accumulation.

**Real Example:**
```
Stock: COIN

Yesterday: Volume 3x normal, stock up 8%
Today: Volume 2.5x normal, stock up another 4%

RVOL 5d: 2.2x

Score: +12 points

Translation: "Explosive move. Could run further, but 
risk of short-term pullback after this surge."
```

#### **Steady Volume: +8 points**

**Criteria:**
- RVOL around 1.0-1.2x
- Consistent, not accelerating

**Why This Scores Moderate:**
Normal volume. No urgency, but no red flags either.

#### **Declining Volume: +3 points**

**Criteria:**
- RVOL below 1.0x
- Volume declining as price rises

**Why This Scores Low:**
Volume should confirm price. If volume is dying as price rises, the move may not be sustainable.

**Real Example:**
```
Stock: XOM

Price up 5% this week
RVOL: 0.7x (below normal)

Score: +3 points

Translation: "Price rising but no one cares. Weak move, 
likely to fail."
```

---

## ⚖️ FACTOR 3: Risk/Reward (20 Points)

**Purpose:** How much upside potential vs downside risk does this setup have?

### Part A: Upside Potential (15 points)

#### **High Catch-Up Potential: +15 points**

**Criteria (ALL must be true):**
1. Stock is lagging sector by 3%+ (sector alpha - stock alpha ≥ 3%)
2. Sector is strong (score 70+)
3. Stock has historically caught up in prior rotations
4. Stock showing early signs of acceleration

**Why This Scores Highest:**
When a strong sector has a laggard that's starting to wake up, that laggard often catches up violently. Massive upside potential.

**Real Example:**
```
Technology Sector: 85 (A)
Sector is outperforming by +4%

Stock: INTC
Stock alpha: +0.5% (lagging sector by 3.5%)

Historical pattern: INTC typically catches NVDA/AMD 
when tech rallies

Score: +15 points ✓

Translation: "Tech is hot, INTC hasn't moved. When it 
catches up, it could jump 5-10% fast to match peers."
```

#### **Moderate Potential (Tracking Sector): +10 points**

**Criteria:**
- Stock alpha roughly equal to sector alpha (within 1%)
- Stock will move with sector

**Why This Scores Moderate:**
Stock will participate in sector move, but won't outperform dramatically. Solid but not spectacular.

#### **Limited Upside (Already Ahead): +5 points**

**Criteria:**
- Stock alpha already 3%+ ahead of sector
- Stock has outperformed peers

**Why This Scores Low:**
Stock may consolidate while sector catches up. Limited incremental upside.

**Real Example:**
```
Energy Sector: 72 (B)
Sector outperforming by +2%

Stock: XOM
Stock alpha: +6% (4% ahead of sector)

Score: +5 points

Translation: "XOM already ran. Sector needs to catch up 
to it. Limited upside from here."
```

---

### Part B: Downside Protection (5 points)

#### **Strong Support Structure: +5 points**

**Criteria (ALL must be true):**
1. Price > 50 MA > 200 MA (perfect alignment)
2. Recent support level tested and held (e.g., previous low bounced)
3. Clear stop-loss level defined

**Why This Scores Full Points:**
Clear technical structure. You know exactly where you're wrong.

**Real Example:**
```
Stock: AAPL

Price: $190
50 MA: $185
200 MA: $175

Recent low: $186 (tested 50 MA and bounced)

Stop loss: $183 (below 50 MA)

Score: +5 points ✓

Translation: "If you're wrong, you'll know quickly. 
Stop at $183 = only 3.7% risk."
```

#### **Weak Support: +0 points**

**Criteria:**
- Price below key MAs
- No clear support level
- Wide stop required

**Why This Scores Zero:**
Higher risk. No clear place to exit if wrong.

---

## 🏢 FACTOR 4: Sector Context (10 Points)

**Purpose:** Bonus/penalty based on what stage the sector is in.

#### **Early Stage Sector: +10 points** (PERFECT TIMING)

**Criteria:**
- Sector in "Early Stage Leadership"
- Sector Day 1-3 in current quadrant
- Sector score 70+

**Why This Scores Highest:**
You're entering a stock as its sector is just heating up. Perfect alignment of stock and sector timing.

**Real Example:**
```
Technology Sector: 78 (B)
Status: Early Stage Leadership (Day 2)

Stock: AMD (any early-stage setup)

Score: +10 points ✓

Translation: "Sector just turned hot. You're entering 
the stock AND the sector early. Double benefit."
```

#### **Established Sector: +5 points** (STILL GOOD)

**Criteria:**
- Sector in "Established Leadership"
- Sector score 65+
- Sector Day 4-10

**Why This Scores Half:**
Sector still strong, but not fresh. Good but not ideal timing.

#### **Topping Sector: -10 points** (WRONG SECTOR - PENALTY)

**Criteria:**
- Sector in "Topping/Weakening"
- Or sector score <50

**Why This Gets Penalized:**
Even a great stock setup in a weak sector is risky. Sector rotation will hurt you.

**Real Example:**
```
Utilities Sector: 35 (F)
Status: Weak/Lagging

Stock: NEE (perfect technical setup)

Score: -10 points ✗

Translation: "Your stock might be perfect, but you're 
fighting sector rotation. Wrong place to be."
```

- Setup: +10 (still in uptrend, just late)
- Timing: +5 (extended but not broken)
- Risk/Reward: +5 (limited but not negative)

Then extended penalty: -15

**Final: 55-60 range → 58 (D)**

**Label: ⚡ Extended - Wait for Pullback**

**Translation:**
"NVDA is a great stock in a great sector. But it's already run 15%+ 
in 3 weeks. You're late. If you're already in, great - hold it. 
If you're not in, WAIT. Let it pull back to $160-165 (currently $180). 
Don't chase momentum."

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: A stock has been up 20% and has a score of 65. Why so low?**

A: Because it already ran! The goal is to catch moves EARLY, not chase them. That stock scored high 3 weeks ago when it was just turning positive. Now it's late. Let it pull back before re-entering.

---

**Q: Why does this "weak" stock score higher than that "strong" stock?**

A: Because the "weak" stock is at an inflection point (turning from negative to positive) while the "strong" stock is extended (already +8% and stretched). We want the turn, not the top.

---

**Q: The sector is super hot, why aren't all the stocks scored high?**

A: Because some already ran! If the sector is hot Day 15 and a stock is up 15%, that's LATE. We're looking for stocks in hot sectors that HAVEN'T moved yet - the laggards waking up.

---

**Q: Should I ignore anything scored below 70?**

A: Not necessarily. Look at WHY it scored low. If it's "extended but still in uptrend," that's different than "broken and declining." Use the score as a starting point, then read the details.

---

**Q: Can I still make money on "extended" stocks?**

A: Yes, but the risk/reward is worse. If a stock is up 15% and scores 55, it might go up another 5% - but it could also pull back 10%. Better to wait for the pullback or focus on fresh setups.

---

**Q: What if a stock scores 90 but the sector is weak?**

A: The sector penalty will bring it down. Even a great stock setup in a bad sector is risky. Stick to stocks in sectors with Early Stage or Established Leadership.

---

**Q: How often do scores update?**

A: Every 10 minutes during market hours (based on your data refresh). Scores can change daily as alpha values and volume patterns shift.

## 🎯 The Bottom Line

**This system is designed to help you:**
1. ✅ Catch rotation EARLY (not chase it late)
2. ✅ Enter at inflection points (0-2% alpha, just turning positive)
3. ✅ Avoid extended stocks (already +5-8%, too late)
4. ✅ Identify laggards waking up in hot sectors
5. ✅ Buy pullbacks in strong stocks

**This system is NOT designed to:**
1. ❌ Highlight stocks already up 15% (that's for performance tracking, not entry)
2. ❌ Find the "strongest" stocks (we want the ones ABOUT to be strong)
3. ❌ Rank by current alpha (high current alpha = often too late)

**Think of it this way:**
- **High Score (85+):** "Get in NOW, this is the turn!"
- **Medium Score (70):** "Decent setup, be selective"
- **Low Score (55):** "Too late, wait for pullback"

*Remember: The best entries feel uncomfortable. If a stock is obviously strong and everyone is talking about it, you're probably late. The goal is to buy BEFORE it's obvious!*
